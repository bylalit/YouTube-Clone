▶️ YouTube Clone Application

Link of this project to show: https://you-tube-clone-five-topaz.vercel.app/

This project is a YouTube Clone application built using React.js to replicate the core features of YouTube in a simple and user-friendly way. The main purpose of this project is to practice React concepts and learn how to work with third-party APIs to fetch and display real-time data.

The application uses a third-party YouTube API to fetch videos, channel details, and search results dynamically. Users can search for videos, view video lists, and watch videos directly within the application. All data is loaded in real time through API calls, which helps in understanding how real-world applications consume external APIs.

On the frontend, the project is developed using React functional components, hooks, and component-based architecture. The UI is designed to be clean and responsive, making it easy to use on different screen sizes. Proper state management and API handling are implemented to ensure smooth performance.

This project focuses on learning API integration, React hooks, component reuse, and asynchronous data handling. It also helps in understanding how large platforms like YouTube structure their frontend applications.

Overall, this project is a great example of frontend development using React and working with external APIs in a practical and real-world manner.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
